## Features

- **RTL Layout**: The entire website is right-aligned and optimized for Persian reading direction.
- **Iranian Cuisine**: Menu items have been replaced with traditional Iranian foods like Kebabs and Khoreshs.
- **Iranian Context**: Awards, addresses, and other details have been adapted to Iranian context.
- **Logo Removal**: All Gericht logos have been removed to create a neutral Iranian restaurant theme.
